Summary: The aim is to develop an online real estate management system for property 
managers to list and manage properties, tenants to search and rent properties, and 
administrators to oversee the entire system. Each user type will have a dedicated dashboard for 
managing and accessing their functionalities.

Description: The system will facilitate property listing, rental agreements, and tenant 
management, while also providing features for user management and system oversight. 
Property managers will handle property listings and tenant communication, tenants will search 
and apply for rentals, and administrators will manage users, property listings, and system 
settings.
